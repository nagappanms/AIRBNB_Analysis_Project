# AIRBNB_Analysis

# Description:
  Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their property with people who are looking for accommodations, typically for short stays. Airbnb offers hosts a relatively easy way to earn some income from their property. Guests often find that Airbnb rentals are cheaper and homier than hotels.

# Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb listing data to uncover insights about pricing, demand, and other key factors that influence the short-term rental market. The data contains various attributes like price, room type, location, and availability, which can provide valuable information for both hosts and guests.

# Approach:
1. **Data Collection** : Obtain Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb.

2. **Data Preprocessing** : Clean the dataset by handling missing values and transforming data types. This includes removing null values, converting price columns from strings to numeric 
     values, and filtering out non-relevant listings.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)** : Conduct EDA to summarize the main characteristics of the dataset. Visualize distributions, correlations, and trends using Python libraries such as 
     Matplotlib and Seaborn.

4. **Visualization** : Create detailed visualizations to represent the findings from the EDA.

5. **Streamlit Application** : Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit for dynamic data exploration and visualization.

6. **MongoDB Integration** : Store the processed dataset in MongoDB to leverage its scalability and flexibility for handling large datasets.

7. **PowerBI/Tableau** : Utilize PowerBI or Tableau for creating advanced and interactive visualizations for deeper insights.
   
# Objectives:

- Understand Price Distribution: Analyze the distribution of prices across different listings to identify patterns and outliers.

- Room Type Analysis: Investigate how different room types (e.g., entire home/apartment, private room) affect pricing and demand.

- Location Insights: Determine how the location of listings impacts price and availability.

- Availability and Demand: Explore the relationship between listing availability and booking trends.

- Interactive Exploration: Enable users to interactively explore the dataset through a web application.

- Scalable Data Storage: Store the data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.

# Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listing data, revealing key insights into pricing, demand, and other influencing factors. By leveraging Python for data processing and visualization, Streamlit for interactive exploration, and MongoDB for scalable data storage, we have created a robust framework for understanding the short-term rental market. Additionally, the use of PowerBI/Tableau enhances the ability to visualize complex relationships within the data, offering actionable insights for hosts and guests alike.
